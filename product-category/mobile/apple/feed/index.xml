<p>Just the right amount</p>
<p>of everything.</p>
<p>A new dual‑camera system captures more of what you see and love. The fastest chip ever in a smartphone and all‑day battery life let you do more and charge less. And the highest‑quality video in a smartphone, so your memories look better than ever.</p>
<p>Love at first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sight.</p>
<p>It just got a whole lot harder to take a bad photo.</p>
<p>All‑new dual‑camera system. Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective.</p>
<p>Kick your video up a notch. Over a smidge. Or down a hair.</p>
<p>“OK, everyone, scooch out a bit.”</p>
<p>New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 kilometers for.</p>
<p>Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‑light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter.</p>
<p>Night mode off.</p>
<p>Portrait-perfect.</p>
<p>Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‑legged or four.</p>
<p>High-Key Light Mono effect in iOS 13 transforms your portraits into beautiful, studio‑style monochromes. And Portrait Lighting Control lets you create the look you want by changing the intensity of light on your subjects.</p>
<p>Smart HDR.</p>
<p>The easiest form of flattery.</p>
<p>Next‑generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‑looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>Go from pics to video faster than a speeding toddler.</p>
<p>Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, the A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject.</p>
<p>Slo-mo your selfie.</p>
<p>Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.</p>
<p>Designed to take a spill and a splash.</p>
<p>The toughest glass in a smartphone.</p>
<p>Front glass and back glass are strengthened through a dual ion‑exchange process.</p>
<p>Water resistant to</p>
<p>twice the depth.</p>
<p>iPhone 11 is water resistant up to 2 meters for up to 30 minutes — double the depth of iPhone XR.1</p>
<p>Compare with iPhone 11 Pro</p>
<p>Roses are red, violets are violet.</p>
<p>Liquid Retina LCD. The true-to-life all-screen design makes everything look amazing.</p>
<p>True Tone. Adjusts the white balance to match the color temperature of the light around you.</p>
<p>Tap or raise to wake. Your iPhone is ready in an instant.</p>
<p>Haptic Touch. Do all kinds of essential things faster with contextual menus and shortcuts.</p>
<p>All in a day’s charge.</p>
<p>All-day battery life. Hardware and software work together to get the most out of your battery. And thanks to fast‑charge capability, you can recharge in less time</p>
<p>A chip that’s all Pro.</p>
<p>Both iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro have the fastest chip ever in a smartphone. A13 Bionic is so powerful, everything you do is fast and fluid. It also works in the most power‑efficient way possible, so your battery lasts longer. In fact, A13 Bionic is so advanced, it’s years ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>Share. Find. Play. More precisely than ever.</p>
<p>Ultra Wideband technology comes to iPhone. The new Apple‑designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness — allowing iPhone 11 to precisely locate other U1‑equipped Apple devices. Think GPS at the scale of your living room. So if you want to share a file with someone using AirDrop, just point your iPhone at theirs and they’ll be first on the list</p>
<p>Love it. Even when you leave it.</p>
<p>iPhone holds its value longer. Every iPhone is engineered with premium materials and built to last. But when it’s finally time to let go — we feel you — trade it in for your next iPhone. Your old one will be recycled or go to a new owner.</p>

<p>And then there was Pro.</p>
<p>A transformative triple‑camera system that adds tons of capability without complexity. An unprecedented leap in battery life. And a mind‑blowing chip that doubles down on machine learning and pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do. Welcome to the first iPhone powerful enough to be called Pro.</p>
<p>Take a closer look.</p>
<p>Two sizes. Four finishes. Stainless steel and glass design.</p>
<p>Pro camera system</p>
<p>We’ve three‑upped ourselves.</p>
<p>Expanded field of view. iPhone 11 Pro lets you zoom from the Telephoto all the way out to the new Ultra Wide camera, for an impressive 4x optical zoom range.</p>
<p>Elegant, immersive interface. We leveraged the wider field of view to let you see what’s happening outside the image frame — and simply tap to capture it. And there’s almost nothing between you and your subject except a new, Pro camera font. So you’re always fully immersed in the scene.</p>
<p>4K video</p>
<p>Shoot it. Flip it. Zoom it. Crop it. Cut it. Light it. Tweak it. Love it.</p>
<p>iPhone 11 Pro lets you capture videos that are beautifully true to life, with greater detail and smoother motion. Epic processing power means it can shoot 4K video with extended dynamic range and cinematic video stabilization — all at 60 fps. You get more creative control, too, with four times more scene and powerful new editing tools to play with.</p>
<p>The highest‑quality video in any smartphone</p>
<p>Ultra Wide</p>
<p>Take it alllllll in.</p>
<p>When you just can’t squeeze everything into the frame, zoom out. Because the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene than ever. It’s like stepping back — way back — without taking a step. Bring on those mountain ranges, soaring cathedrals, and iconic skylines.</p>
<p>Night mode</p>
<p>High tech meets low light.</p>
<p>From dimly lit restaurants to moonlit beaches, the new Night mode uses intelligent software and A13 Bionic to deliver low‑light shots never before possible on iPhone. And it all happens automatically. You can also experiment with manual controls to dial in even more detail and less noise.</p>
<p>Portrait mode</p>
<p>Power to the portrait.</p>
<p>With three cameras working together, you can fit more in your portraits than ever. iOS 13 adds the High‑Key Light Mono effect for studio‑style monochromes. And Portrait Lighting lets you control the intensity of light to flatter your subject — just like you would in a studio. How beautiful is that?</p>
<p>Smart HDR</p>
<p>And you thought your photos couldn’t get any better.</p>
<p>Next-generation Smart HDR uses advanced algorithms to finesse highlight and shadow detail in your image. And now it leverages machine learning to recognize faces in your shot and intelligently relight them. That means iPhone 11 Pro can automatically fine-tune detail in both the subject and the background. Even some DSLR cameras can’t do that.</p>
<p>Be ready when your photo op turns into a video op.</p>
<p>Say you’re taking photos and you see something you’ve got to catch on video. With QuickTake, there’s no need to switch modes. Just leave your finger on the shutter to start recording. Want to keep the recording going? Swipe right. To take burst photos, swipe left.</p>
<p>Why selfie when you can slofie?</p>
<p>The new 12MP TrueDepth camera lets you take superfun slow-motion selfie videos at 120 fps, or shoot in 4K at 60 fps. For stills, the camera now automatically zooms out when you rotate your iPhone, so you can get your whole crew in the shot. Yes, even selfies can be Pro.</p>
<p>Even more cool camera features.</p>
<p>40%</p>
<p>more light capture with Telephoto</p>
<p>36%</p>
<p>brighter True Tone flash with Slow Sync</p>
<p>Zero</p>
<p>shutter lag</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>lighting effects in Portrait mode</p>
<p>2x</p>
<p>more height for panos</p>
<p>OIS</p>
<p>optical image stabilization</p>
<p>Pro display</p>
<p>Super Retina XDR. A sharp contrast from everything else.</p>
<p>The Super Retina XDR display boasts not one but two new peaks of brightness and understands when to use them. It hits up to 800 nits when you’re out in the sun — great for shooting and making selects on the go — and up to 1200 nits when you’re viewing extreme dynamic range content. It’s like having a Pro Display XDR on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The brightest, sharpest iPhone display ever</p>
<p>Up to</p>
<p>800 nits</p>
<p>for better viewing in sunlight</p>
<p>Up to</p>
<p>1200 nits</p>
<p>for HDR photos and HDR10 movies</p>
<p>2,000,000:1</p>
<p>contrast ratio</p>
<p>458 pixels</p>
<p>per inch</p>
<p>Pro performance</p>
<p>A chip so advanced, even we’re trying to catch up.</p>
<p>We custom‑built A13 Bionic with a focus on machine learning across the entire chip — enabling experiences that simply aren’t found on any other smartphone. In fact, it’s so fast, so powerful, and so intelligent, it’s years ahead of any other chip. Which gives you an unfair advantage.</p>
